# Finding a model for axioms A.1-A.4 when n=3

# This script aims to provide a model that satisfies the axioms A.1 to A.4.

# Axiom A.1: [Description of Axiom A.1]
# Axiom A.2: [Description of Axiom A.2]
# Axiom A.3: [Description of Axiom A.3]
# Axiom A.4: [Description of Axiom A.4]

# Define the model for n=3
n = 3

# [Implementation of the model]

# Example implementation
# def model_for_axioms(n):
#     # Logic to find the model
#     pass

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     model_for_axioms(n)
