# Independence of Axioms

# Axiom 1: For any two points, there exists a line that contains them.
# Negation: There exist two points such that no line contains them.

# Axiom 2: For any two lines, there exists a point that is on both lines.
# Negation: There exist two lines such that no point is on both lines.

# Axiom 3: Through any point, there exists at least one line.
# Negation: There exists a point such that no line passes through it.

# Axiom 4: Any two lines intersect in at most one point.
# Negation: There exist two lines that intersect in more than one point.

# Axiom 5: A line segment can be extended infinitely in both directions.
# Negation: There exists a line segment that cannot be extended infinitely in either direction.
